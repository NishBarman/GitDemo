  Scenario Outline: Verify if place is being successfuly added using add place API
    Given Add place Payload with "<name>" "<language>" "<address>"
    When User calls "AddPlaceAPI" with "Post" http request
    Then API call is success with status code 200
    And "status" in response body is "OK"
    And "scope" in response body is "APP"
	  Then verify place_Id created maps to "<name>" using "getPlaceAPI"
